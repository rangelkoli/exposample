# Sample Expo App

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

This project uses [`react-native-reanimated`](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/) for animations as I felt it was the most upto date and well maintained github repo, so in the future it would be easier and better to use.

## Improvements for a Real App

- Could add accessibility labels and also hints for the markers in the map
- Could group markers when the map is zoomed out enough so that the app wont break when there are a lot more markers
